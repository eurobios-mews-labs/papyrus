| PyMuPDFExtractor        |        X        |                |
| PyPDF2Extractor         |        X        |                |
| CamelotExtractor        |                 |              X |
  
2. Depending on the extractor chosen you can extract only text or only table or both.
The available extractors are [pdfplumber, pymupdf, pypdf2, camelot, docling]

````python
from papyrus.core import PapyrusExtractor

file_path = "invoice_100.pdf"
# instanciate PapyrusExtractor with a name of pdf plumber extractor 
papyrus = PapyrusExtractor("pdfplumber")
#extract only text
text = papyrus.get_text(file_path)
#print the result
print(text)
#extract only tables
tables = papyrus.get_tables(file_path)
print(tables)
#extract both text and tables
text_tables = papyrus.get_all(file_path)
